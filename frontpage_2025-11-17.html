                                                ITAK MP S. Shritharan stated that, despite sending three letters to the President requesting the release of lands including the Maaveerar Thuyilum Illam (cemeteries) in Theravil and the Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalaya, as well as calling for an end to military interference in civil activities, he has not received a response. Speaking in parliament, Shritharan emphasised that soldiers desecrating these sites by walking on graves with boots widens the gap in reconciliation instead of fostering unity. He pointed out that, just as the current government—which also has a history of struggle—recently commemorated Sinhala youth killed during the insurrection, they must understand the similar pain and sentiments of the Tamil people regarding their own dead. Consequently, he urged the government to release these burial grounds in time for Maaveerar Naal, noting that Minister Chandrashekhar had previously indicated the President's willingness to release such lands in the North and East.

                                                            Illegal construction work led by a monk was reportedly undertaken yesterday (16th) without authorisation at the Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Bodhi Raja Vihara premises near the Dutch Bay coast at Fort Frederick, Trincomalee. Officials from the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management and journalists who visited to inspect the unauthorised activities were threatened and forced to leave the site. Following a complaint lodged by department officials at the Trincomalee Harbour Police, construction work has now been temporarily suspended, and the police have filed a court case regarding the incident. Reports indicate that, despite a previous attempt earlier this month to remove an illegal canteen and an ongoing legal dispute with the municipal council, permanent construction was secretly initiated overnight on Saturday (15th) without the required approval from the relevant authorities.

Perera alleged that the government has an agreement with plantation companies and called on the authorities to audit these companies' profits to ensure workers receive the maximum benefit. Perera claimed that the government had misrepresented a statement by SJB MP Rohini Kavirathna on the Rs. 200 wage increase for political purposes, clarifying that she had merely highlighted legal procedural flaws. He further alleged that plantation owners supported President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's victory and informally refer to him as 'Machan.' Perera also criticised the 2026 Budget, claiming it favours the capitalist class while offering no relief to the middle class.

Thirumavalavan stated that countries worldwide study LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran's military strategies in their military colleges due to his tactical skill and reputation for invincibility. Speaking at an event at Nallur Kittu Park in Jaffna, Thirumavalavan recalled his close association with the LTTE leader and praised Prabhakaran's geopolitical insight, referencing his 2002 description of Norway as the friendly face of America. He commented that, unlike current leaders who speak frequently, the entire world would wait for Prabhakaran's single annual address on Maaveerar Naal (Great Heroes' Day). He further observed that Prabhakaran never portrayed the Indian government as an enemy, understanding that Tamil aspirations could only be met with India's support. <em>Thinakkural</em> also quoted Thirumavalavan as saying that Eelam Tamils should abandon the belief that Tamil Eelam could be achieved simply through agitation in Tamil Nadu. Instead, he urged unity under a single leadership to address the Tamil issue.

He added that Rs. 660,000 was spent on Pirith chanting at the Carlton Residence in Tangalle on April 9, 2014, marking Namal Rajapaksa’s birthday and New Year celebrations. The Minister made this statement during the Committee Stage debate on the Appropriation Bill. Nanayakkara stated that this highlights how former presidents utilised their expenditure heads while state revenue was negative.

The GMOA is implementing this as a form of trade union action to protest the government’s failure to address their demands in the recent budget. Measures include stopping the provision of prescriptions for medicines not available in state hospitals but available in outside pharmacies and restricting recommendations for tests by external laboratories.

                                                A five-member Criminal Investigation Department (CID) team has travelled to the United Kingdom (UK) to investigate the authenticity of the invitation letter reportedly sent by the University of Wolverhampton to former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, news reports state that this visit was carried out without informing the Attorney General (AG). Furthermore, it is reported that the AG’s Department was not notified about the CID team's trip, nor were instructions sought from senior CID officers leading the investigation prior to their departure. The team, led by a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) and including an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), a Chief Inspector (CI), and two junior officers, flew to the UK earlier this week for a five-day visit.
